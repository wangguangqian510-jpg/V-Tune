/// One-shot launch migration that deduplicates OAuth-typed
/// `MusicSource` rows by upstream account identity. Splits the legacy
/// "every OAuth flow mints a new UUID" model into the post-stage-4
/// "one CloudAccount per upstream account, mounts hang off it" shape
/// without forcing the user to re-add anything.
///
/// Algorithm per launch:
/// 1. Collect every active OAuth-typed source.
/// 2. For each, instantiate the connector and call
///    `accountIdentifier()`. Skip sources that fail (network down,
///    token revoked) — they'll be retried on the next launch.
/// 3. Group by `(provider, accountUID)`. Single-mount groups just get
///    a `CloudAccount` record + `mount.cloudAccountID` set.
/// 4. Multi-mount groups: keep the row with the newest
///    `lastScannedAt` as the keeper, repoint every other group
///    member's songs to the keeper's id, then soft-delete the
///    redundant rows via `SourcesStore.remove()`. That fires
///    `primuseSourceDidSoftDelete`, which CloudKitSyncService
///    translates to a real `deleteRecord` push — clearing the
///    upstream "5 baidu sources" garbage.
///
/// Idempotent. The `migrationKey` UserDefaults flag guards against a
/// repeat run; clearing the flag forces a re-migration on next launch
/// (useful for support / debugging).
