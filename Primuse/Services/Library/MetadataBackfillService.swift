/// Lifecycle:
/// - App launch / foreground / BGProcessingTask wake → `start(...)` kicks off

///   actually parallelize; one worker per source plus shared throttle is the

/// - Failed songs (corrupt / missing / decoder rejected) are recorded so we
///   don't retry them every launch. Successful ones are replaced in the
///   library and persist via `MusicLibrary.persistSnapshot()`.
