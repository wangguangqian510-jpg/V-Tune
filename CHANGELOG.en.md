## [1.7.3] (build 24) - 2026-07-26

This release consolidates changes made after 1.7.0 that had not yet been documented, with a focus on very large libraries, real multi-source deletion, Apple Music, Baidu Netdisk, search playback, CarPlay, and cross-device sync.

### Added

- **Real deletion across music sources** — duplicate cleanup can call each source's deletion capability instead of only removing local records, with batching, progress recovery, and retry support
- **Mixed-source playback queues** — one queue can continuously play local, NAS, cloud-drive, Subsonic, and media-server tracks
- **Persistent search index** — indexes titles, artists, albums, Pinyin, and lyrics for faster large-library search and lyric hits
- **Airsonic compatibility mode** — handles the Subsonic API differences in both classic and Advanced releases across scanning, artwork, lyrics, and Range playback
- **Remote notification support** — adds the app-level registration and handling foundation for remote notifications
- **CarPlay search entry** — adds an always-visible Search row to songs, albums, artists, playlists, and recent items, with recent phone search terms and matching results available in-car

### Changed

- **Apple Music library sync** — rebuilt synchronization, identity mapping, and play-history association to reduce duplicates and stay aligned with the system library
- **Apple Music lyric scraping** — service-owned work now continues after the player collapses and stores lyrics against the canonical song identity
- **Source scanning** — added directory-selection sessions, batched scan mutations and checkpoints, and improved FTP continuity and remote metadata parsing
- **Source counts** — source cards are reconciled against the device's actual library instead of displaying stale cloud snapshots or historical scan totals
- **iCloud lyric snapshots** — oversized inline payloads progressively shrink to the newest subset that fits instead of dropping the whole lyric snapshot
- **App icons and cloud sync** — refreshed the icon system and reduced unnecessary synchronization and view updates

### Fixed

- **Baidu smart duplicate cleanup** — validates every per-file batch result so partial failures are not reported as success or written as false local deletions
- **Baidu large-directory scans** — retries transient read failures and rate limits with backoff instead of abandoning the selected directory
- **Search-result playback crash** — keeps the tab and bottom-player view structure stable while the system search controller is dismissed
- **CloudKit and SMB crashes** — disables sync safely when CloudKit entitlements are unavailable and serializes SMB session lifecycles to prevent scrape-write/disconnect races
- **Batch-scrape accuracy** — uses stable remote identity seeds and confidence-based matching, keeps duplicate copies consistent, rejects overlapping batches, and stops repeated writes to read-only or unauthorized sources
- **Large-library stalls** — fixed cold-launch, song-list refresh, background scraping, and bulk-cleanup paths that could freeze the UI or trigger the scene watchdog
- **Duplicate cleanup** — fixed stale results, interrupted batches that could not resume, and missing real deletion for Baidu sources
- **Local-file recovery** — safely rebases old sandbox paths into the current container and stops custom local sources from being redirected to the managed import folder
- **Local playback caching** — local files no longer enter the remote offline-cache pipeline, preventing duplicate storage and misleading warnings
- **MV pause behavior** — pausing video also cancels the full-file background download while retaining its partial file for later use
- **Scraping and translation logs** — empty titles no longer query online providers, and lyrics already in the target language no longer create no-op translation failures
- **Simulator credentials** — uses local Keychain items when synchronizable Keychain attributes are unavailable, preserving credentials across app restarts
- **Audio session startup** — cold launch no longer interrupts audio already playing in another app
- **Malformed media and playback menus** — hardened invalid inputs, Now Playing menu updates, and lyric-scrolling edge cases

### Performance

- **Library lookup** — replaces repeated full scans with caching and a persistent search index, reducing CPU while typing in very large libraries
- **Scanning and cleanup** — batches song mutations and lowers checkpoint and UI publication frequency instead of persisting once per track
- **Foreground batch work** — requests the finite iOS background-execution window only after the app actually backgrounds, eliminating long foreground-scrape warnings
- **Lyrics and Now Playing** — reduces view recomputation from lyric scrolling and playback progress while keeping menus stable during high-frequency updates

## [1.7.0] (build 20) - 2026-07-18

This release starts at commit `4a8937f9` and focuses on large-library performance, the Home and Library experience, and cross-platform polish for iPhone, Mac, and Apple TV.

### Added

- **Customizable Home sections** — show, hide, and reorder Continue Listening, Quick Favorites, For You, My Playlists, Top Artists, Recently Added, and listening statistics
- **Quick Favorites and search** — pin albums, artists, or playlists; search while editing; and keep selected items together for faster removal
- **First-install feature tour** — introduces cloud drives, NAS, Apple Music, metadata scraping, cross-device playback, app icons, and Home customization
- **Complete release notes** — update prompts can expand and collapse long notes
- **GitHub feedback links** — open the repository or Issues from About for faster reporting and follow-up

### Changed

- **NAS support status** — UGREEN UGOS and Feiniu fnOS now show as unavailable while awaiting vendor-supported public APIs and can’t enter the new-source setup flow
- **123 Cloud Drive OAuth callback** — replaced the HTTPS relay with the registered app deep link and added strict scheme, host, path, and state validation
- **Home and Library layout** — introduced clearer card hierarchies and redesigned Quick Favorites plus the Songs, Albums, Artists, and Playlists entry points
- **Music video playback** — videos are larger in portrait, automatically enter landscape fullscreen on iPhone, and restore the previous orientation on exit
- **Apple Music playlist visibility** — read-only mirror playlists are hidden while Apple Music sync or its source is disabled and return when re-enabled
- **macOS and tvOS adaptation** — improved localization, branding, Mac settings, Apple TV navigation, and remote playback controls

### Fixed

- **Song titles** — scanning and metadata backfill now prefer embedded titles instead of always showing filenames
- **Spotlight stability** — artwork thumbnails now use ImageIO off the main thread, fixing a UIKit rendering crash and reducing peak memory use
- **tvOS navigation and playback controls** — fixed filter focus, returning to the tab bar, global play/pause, and remote-command main-thread handling

### Performance

- **Scanning and tag reading** — batch library mutations, publish progress and checkpoints less often, and move large JSON encoding off the main thread
- **Home and source list** — cache Home snapshots, artwork tints, source-song groups, and remaining-backfill counts to avoid repeated work while scrolling
- **Large-library indexing** — batch artwork invalidations and checkpoint writes to reduce main-thread overhead during continuous 10K-track scans

## Early standalone macOS releases

### [1.1.0] (build 2) - 2026-05

A stability and experience update after the initial macOS 1.0.0 release, bringing over important iOS fixes and polishing Mac-specific windows and layout.

#### Added

- **Source authentication feedback** — background connection failures now show an error and let users re-enter credentials
- **Negative cache for failed lyrics translation** — deterministic unsupported-language errors are cached for 24 hours instead of retried on every playback
- **Content-addressed artwork storage** — `MetadataAssets/content/<sha>.jpg` lets tracks from the same album share one physical JPEG
- **Automatic content eviction** — background garbage collection removes orphaned content and evicts oldest files beyond 500 MB
- **Desktop lyrics and menu-bar controls** — continued refinement of the macOS-specific playback surfaces introduced in 1.0

#### Changed

- **Library tools moved out of Settings** — rescan, re-scrape, and cache controls now live with the Library
- **Scrape sheets default to full height** — automatic and manual scrape actions no longer appear missing below a medium sheet
- **Native scraping window** — macOS scraping now opens in an `NSWindow` with standard traffic-light controls

#### Fixed

- **Apply changes stall and crash** — closes the scraping window first, then applies library and sidecar changes in a background task
- **Synology login storms and DSM blocking** — concurrent requests for one source now share a single in-flight login
- **SFTP `try!` crash risk** — authentication is resolved before capture instead of force-throwing inside a callback
- **Lost partial translations** — completed responses are retained when a later translation batch throws
- **Legacy local-reference precedence** — corrected an unused but invalid `&&` / `||` expression
- **Broken word-level lyrics rendering** — fixed discontinuous masks on macOS
- **Lyrics not refreshing after scraping** — successful scraping now reloads the active lyrics view

#### Performance

- **Artwork storage reduced by about 98%** — typical same-album artwork drops from many duplicate JPEGs to one shared file plus tiny redirect records
- **Single Synology login** — concurrent playback and prefetch requests reuse one authentication task
- **Removed duplicate post-scrape refreshes** — the shared song-replacement notification is now the only refresh path

---

### [1.0.0] (build 1) - 2026-04

The first standalone macOS release.

#### Added

- Cross-platform playback, scraping, sidecar write-back, and library management
- Floating desktop lyrics
- Menu-bar playback controls
- A three-column Mac interface with a sidebar, detail area, and bottom player
- A floating mini player
- Fullscreen macOS Now Playing
- OAuth callbacks through the `primuse://` URL scheme
